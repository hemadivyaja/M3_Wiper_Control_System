**BASIC REQUIREMENTS:**

**INTRODUCTION:**

Wiper system is a inseperable aspect is modern automobiles especially 4-wheelers. They are designed and made to clear the dust, water, fog, mist from the windshield and give driver a better and clear vision of the road ahead. The parts are visible from outside the car. It has a rubber blade made of silicon, wiper arm attached to the silicon blade, extendable linkage, pivots. Existing system used manually used to activate the wiper and the process of pulling up wiper and the driver needs to switch ON and OFF the control system.

**OBJECTIVES:**

* To design and implement a new mechanism to cover the area of automobile's windshield.
* The purpose of the wiper system is to clean the windshield effectively to provide clear vision for the driver.
* The system contains a microcontroller that takes input signals from the sensor and controls the operation.

**4W's AND 1H:**

**WHAT:**

* The windshield wiper sontrol system consists of wipers and wiper arms

**WHEN:**

* It can be used when there is rainfall, cleaning the winshield after a long time, dusty conditions etc.

**WHERE:**

* It is used to remove water, dirt, dust, smoke, fog, mist etc.

**WHO:**

* It is used by the drivers of heavy automobiles and domestic 4-wheelers.

**HOW:**

* They can be operated by electric motors.
